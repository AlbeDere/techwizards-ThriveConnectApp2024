### 2. **Additional Notes for Implementation**

1. **Embedding Generation**: The `createEmbedding()` method in each relevant class should use LangChain's embedding model (e.g., GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings) to transform textual data (skills, values) into vectors that are stored in a vector database.
2. **Compatibility Scoring**: The `calculateFinalScore()` in the `Match` class should allow for dynamic weight adjustments. This will be essential for balancing skill vs. values alignment in the final compatibility score.
3. **Data Collection and Storage**: Ensure that any anonymous feedback collected from the `Feedback` class is appropriately anonymized and securely stored.
4. **Interface Design**: The `displayMatchDetails()` method in `Match` should prepare data in a user-friendly format for the UI, emphasizing compatibility scores to help users quickly gauge potential matches.
5. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement comprehensive error handling, especially in methods that interact with external data (e.g., embedding APIs or sentiment analysis). Console logging and UI feedback will also improve the debugging and user experience.
